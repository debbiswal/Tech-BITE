|Storage|S3/EBS/EFS/Instance Store|Blob Storage|Object Storage|Amazon Offers 4 types of storage services like EBS, EC2 Instance Store, Elastic File System (EFS) and Simple Storage Service (S3).<br><br>EBS - Amazon EBS provides durable, block-level storage volumes that you can attach to a running instance you can use Amazon EBS as a primary storage device for data that requires frequent and granular updates  <br><br>Instance Store – Disk storage, which is physically attached to the instance the data on an instance store volume, persists only during the life of the associated instance <br><br>EFS - Amazon EFS provides scalable file storage for use with Amazon EC2. You can use an EFS file system as a common data source for workloads and applications running on multiple instances <br><br>S3 - Amazon S3 provides access to reliable and inexpensive object data storage infrastructure<br>Azure storage provides the following four services: Blob storage, Table storage, Queue storage, and File storage. Blob Storage stores unstructured object data. A blob can be any type of text or binary data, such as a document, media file, or application installer. Blob storage is also referred to as Object storage<br><br>Google cloud offers 2 types of storages Persistent Disk and Cloud Storage <br><br>Persistent Disk - Google Persistent Disk is durable and high performance block storage for the Google Cloud Platform. Key features are “Scale without Interruption”, “multi-reader capability” and “Better Snapshot Performance”<br><br>Cloud Storage - Google Cloud Storage is unified object storage |
|Compute|EC2|VM|Compute Engine|Amazon offers Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2) service which provides scalable computing capacity which is known as EC2 Instance. Similarly Google cloud offers Google Cloud Engine (GCE). To create an instance both Amazon & Google cloud offers what variety of instance types which are with different combination of CPU/Memory/Storage capabilities. Amazon has wide variety of instance types (~ 45 types) which matches most of the needs whereas Google cloud has fewer instance types (~ 18 types) which may serve the common needs. Additionally Google cloud offers a facility where users can create custom instances with their own of CPU/Memory combinations.
Azure  has less variety in VM families compared to AWS, but on the other hand, much more flexibility with regards to machine size. Its families include general-purpose, optimized machines (better CPU, more RAM and more SSD storage), performance-optimized (even more than “optimized”) and network-optimized (32Gbps Infiniband networking). |
